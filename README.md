## ⚙️ Data Source and Preparation  

### **Files Used** 

- [Indian General Election Result Anlaysis.pbix](Indian%20General%20Election%20Result%20Anlaysis.pbix)  
- [constituencywise_results](constituencywise_results.csv)  
- [constituencywise_details](constituencywise_details.csv)  
- [partywise_results](partywise_results.csv)  
- [statewise_results](statewise_results.csv)  
- [states](states.csv)  
- [DAX_Measures](DAX%20MEASURES.docx)  


### **Data Transformation (Power Query)**  
- Imported all CSV files using **Get Data > Text/CSV**.  
- Expanded nested details (candidates, votes, parties).  
- Cleaned and standardized column names (`Constituency_ID`, `Party`, `Votes`, `Turnout`).  
- Created calculated columns (e.g., `VoteShare`, `Margin`).  
- Removed duplicate/unnecessary metadata columns.  

### **Relationships**  
- **States → Constituencies → Candidates** (hierarchical model).  
- **Partywise Results** linked with state and constituency data.  
- Cross-filtering enabled across **State**, **Party**, and **Constituency**.
